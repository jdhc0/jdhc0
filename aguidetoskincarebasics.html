    <h1>A Guide to Skincare Basics</h1>
<p>Taking care of your skin doesn’t exactly mean having a clear complexion. The skin is the largest organ of the body and serves as a protective barrier against things like environmental factors, harmful UV rays, pollutants, and more. This blog post will briefly cover the basics of skincare, covering topics like why it’s important to stay consistent, ingredients to avoid, and external factors that contribute to worse skin health.</p>
<h3>Why is skincare important?</h3>
	<p>Skincare helps prevent issues like acne, dryness, sensitivity, premature aging, and infections. A tailored skincare routine helps address specific concerns and can improve overall texture, tone, and appearance of the skin. Skincare also helps protect against sun damage. Exposure to the sun is one of the most significant contributors to skin damage, leading to sunburn, premature aging, hyperpigmentation, and an increased risk of skin cancer. Lastly, skincare is a great form of self-care and can boost confidence! It’s a great form of relaxation because it provides moments of mindfulness and indulgence. The act of doing a daily skincare routine leads to an overall healthier complexion, encouraging you to feel great in your skin. Most importantly, as mentioned previously, the skin is the largest organ of the body. It is crucial to take proactive steps with your skincare so that it can continue to serve as a protective barrier against the many external factors that can detrimentally affect your skin.</p>
	
	<h3>How diet and mental health can affect the skin</h3>
	<p>Stress has a bigger impact on your skin’s health than one may think. It can increase inflammation, lower the skin’s natural barrier function, cause acne breakouts, and impair wound healing. While a skincare routine is helpful, it is also crucial to practice self-care and manage stress as much as possible through mindful techniques. Diet can also significantly impact your skin health. Some foods are linked to skin concerns like inflammation, rosacea, and acne. Below are some common foods that have been linked to skin problems: Dairy High-glycemic foods Gluten Spicy foods Artificial additives and preservatives Vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants are all great forms of nutrition that help protect and maintain your skin’s health. Overall, keeping up with a well-balanced diet (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean proteins) greatly supports skin health. Don’t forget to fulfill your daily water intake everyday! Staying hydrated is important to keep your skin in check as it keeps the skin hydrated, improves elasticity, and aids in removing toxins.</p>
<h3>What are the common skin types?</h3>
<p>Understanding your skin type can guide you in choosing the appropriate skincare products.</p><br>
<ul><li><strong>Normal:</strong> Well-balanced and defined as an even complexion and smooth texture. This skin type neither feels too oily or too dry and is less prone to sensitivity and irritation.</li>
<li><strong>Dry:</strong> Lacks moisture and can feel tight, rough, and/or flaky. This skin type may appear dull with fine lines and requires more hydration and moisturization.</li>
<li><strong>Oily:</strong> Produces excess sebum and the skin appears greasy or shiny. Pores are typically larger in size. This skin type is more prone to acne breakouts and typically requires products that help regulate oil production.</li>
<li><strong>Combination:</strong> A mix of different skin types. This skin type usually has an oily T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) while the rest of the skin is dry or normal.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive:</strong> Reacts more easily to different triggers ( skincare ingredients, environmental/external factors, and harsh products). This skin type experiences redness, irritation, itchiness, and/or a burning sensation, and requires more gentle and soothing products. Note that these are general skin types, and it is normal to have a unique combination of them. Environmental factors, aging, hormonal changes, and age can also change your skin type over time.</li></ul><br>
<h3>The basic skincare routine</h3>
<p>If you’re just starting out in the world of skincare, the following routine is simple and includes the essentials you’ll need to improve your overall skin health and complexion. Cleanser: Removes dirt, impurities, and excess oil. Toner: Helps balance the skin’s pH levels and removes any remaining impurities. Moisturizer: Keeps the skin hydrated and helps maintain its moisture barrier. Sunscreen: Protects the skin from harmful UV rays. Optional: Exfoliator: Removes dead skin cells and promotes cell turnover. Eye cream: Gentle enough to be used on the delicate skin around the eyes and addresses concerns such as dark circles, puffiness, and wrinkles. When looking for products that are right for you, it’s important to be mindful of potentially harmful ingredients that may cause irritation, rashes, and allergic reactions. The following are common ingredients found in skincare products that should be avoided. Fragrance Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) Parabens Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde-releasing agents Mineral Oil and Petrolatum Alcohol Lastly, a luxury skincare product with a higher price point (compared to a drugstore skincare product) does not necessarily mean that the quality of the ingredients and/or formulations are better. Effective ingredients can be found in both luxury and drugstore products, so it all boils down to paying the most attention to how well a product and its ingredients work on your skin. Remember, what may work for someone else’s skin may not work for yours!</p>
	<h3>The importance of SPF</h3>
	<p>SPF (also known as Sun Protection Factor) is crucial in a skincare routine to protect the skin against harmful UV (ultraviolet) radiation. Applying sunscreen helps shield the skin from sunburns, premature aging, and an increased risk of skin cancer. It is recommended to use SPF 30 or higher on a daily basis. It’s important to note that, even if a higher SPF is used, the level of protection is only slightly higher and minimal. For example, SPF 30 blocks about 97% of UVB rays, while SPF 50 blocks out about 98%. So, while a higher SPF can provide more protection, it wouldn’t be the end of the world to stick with a lower SPF. Because SPF can only protect against UVB rays (which causes sunburn), using a broad-spectrum sunscreen is ideal. A broad-spectrum sunscreen protects against UVA rays (which can lead to premature aging and skin cancer) and UVB rays. Wearing SPF is still recommended if you’re staying indoors all day. Some types of UV radiation can infiltrate through windows and reach your skin. Exposure to artificial light and electronic devices can be harmful to the skin as well.</p>
	<h3>Important Tips</h3>
	<p><strong>Keep it simple… at first:</strong> As you begin learning more about skincare and what does/doesn’t work for you, remember to keep it simple! It is easy to feel overwhelmed with the seemingly endless amount of skincare products out there. Once you become more familiar with skincare and what skin concerns you need to target, feel free to build onto your routine with more products. <br><br><strong>Stay consistent and be patient:</strong> To see results, it is important to follow a routine as often as you can. You likely will not see results overnight as it takes time for the skin to respond and adjust to products. You may even experience skin purging as it gets used to products; give your skin a couple of weeks to react to them. It takes time to find the perfect routine for you! Listening to your skin is important - if a product causes a skin reaction like irritation, redness, or discomfort, consider discontinuing use and trying something else. Try patch testing new products on a small area of your body beforehand.</p>
	<p>The biggest takeaway in the basics of skincare is that it will take time to find what products and ingredients work best for your skin and its unique concerns. A skincare journey includes a lot of trial and error, but can yield valuable results.</p>
