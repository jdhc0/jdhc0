<h3>A little about me...</h3>
<br>
    <p>Hello, my name is Juliann! I am currently enrolled in the Cybersecurity program at Wake Tech. Prior to this program, I worked in the influencer marketing industry, connecting brands with content creators for partnership opportunities. I made the jump to pursue a Cybersecurity degree after realizing that I enjoy digging into complex problems; nothing in cyber is simple or easy; it's an industry that requires you to adapt and learn every single day.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy playing video games with my friends (mainly Valorant), trying out new cafes, and hanging out at the pool. </p>
<p>Thanks for following me on my journey! Hope you enjoy my little corner of the web.&nbsp;</p>
